## *Semester 01*
### Modern Periodic Table

##### Department of Computer Science & Information Technology
#### Language: C++

A program written in `C++`, that takes an input from `input.txt` file. Input can only be either `Atomic Number` or `Element Symbol`. After, giving input to the program through file, it fetches following information from the given `data` files:
- Atomic Number
- Atomic Radius
- Atomic Weight
- Block
- Boiling Point
- Density 
- Electro-Negativity 
- Electronic Configuration 
- Element Name
- Element Symbol
- Group
- Melting Point

After display fetched data *graphically*, it generates an `output.txt` file. That contains all fetched information in nice and decent formatted way.

(_RAR file, that has an executable, user-manual and other data files_)

It also has an animated intro, that runs only when the program starts.
You can give `run-time` input through file, and receive an output, as many times as you want.

I know, it's not "The Best C++, Modern Periodic Table". But, it is just an initial commit.
I hope, maybe in future, I'll make some changes to the code.

Also, code is not well-optimized yet. :sad :butOK

Anyways, Happy Coding <3
